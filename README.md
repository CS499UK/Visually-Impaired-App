# Visually-Impaired-App

I created this one in eclipse and got it finally working.  

Notes:
  I made got this working in Linux.  Linux projects need the library libtesseract.so instead of the .dll files mentioned on http://tess4j.sourceforge.net/usage.html.  The other thing that was wrong is that Java classes need the JRE library ONLY and definitely won't work if the Android one is included.
